# Recaman sequence

A useless 2-function library.

Mostly served to set up build configurations and environment for a  generic js-library.

If you need a library to create a recaman sequence, there are heaps of them on npm.

This one is very simple.

    get(n) get the n'th number in a recaman sequence.
    sequence(n) returns an array with a receman sequence of n length.
